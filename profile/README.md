# Background

Indonesia has numerous zoos. According to data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK), there were 103 zoos in Indonesia in 2023, spread across 34 provinces. Zoos are places where animals are cared for in artificial environments and displayed to the public. Besides being recreational spaces, zoos also serve as centers for education, research, and the conservation of endangered species.
Many zoo visitors have limited knowledge about the various animals they encounter during their visits. Visitors often lack access to detailed information about these animals. Traditional signage and directions may not provide the desired level of interaction or engagement.
